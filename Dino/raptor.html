HOW ABOUT THIS SHIT HEAD: CUZ THEY'RE BAD ASS THEY'RE SO SMART AND cool and I don't care what Chris Prat or Einstein say, they weren't fucking birds that's bullshit. I don't think Einstein even lived long enough to see Jurassic Park, so what would he know anyway? Bullshit. Anyhow, that about sums up why I like Raptors.</p>
